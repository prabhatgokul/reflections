When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are collaborating in a team or working from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because other people may be collaborating on your work so you would want to make sure that you pull at times that would be appropriate.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are clones of an existing repository on GitHub that is cloned to your remote repository but not yet on your local machine. Clones are copies of a repository that can be made on your local machine or from your local machine to a remote. Branches are different 'lines' of commits within a single git.
	You would use forks when cloning another user's repository but do not have permission to contribute to their repository.
	You would then clone your remote repository to your local machine or clone the repository from your local machine to a remote.
	You would use branches when adding new features to your program.
